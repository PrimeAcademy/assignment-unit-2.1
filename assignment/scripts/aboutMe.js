// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
// used const for name and number since those do not change;
const firstName = "Michael";
// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
const lastName = "Duren";
// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)
const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`
console.log(fullName);
// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.
const luckyNumber = 8;
// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above:
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.
console.log(`My name is ${fullName}, and I think ${luckyNumber} is a winner!`);
// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)
let adventures = true;
// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food
let food = "Burrito";
// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have
let pets = 1;
// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has
let friendsPets = 2;
// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable
let allPets = friendsPets + pets;
// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
const allowedPets = 3;
// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!",
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
adventures ? console.log("Adventures are great!") : console.log("How about we stay at home ? ");
// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
if (luckyNumber == 2 && adventures) {
  console.log("Roll the dice!");
}
// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!"
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.
if (pets < allowedPets) {
  console.log("I can have more pets!");
} else if (pets === allowedPets) {
  console.log("I have enough pets");
} else {
  // another condition is not necessary here IMO, since there can be no other option
  console.log("I have too many pets!");
}
// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios.
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.

let mostPets;

if (pets >= friendsPets) {
  mostPets = pets;
  console.log("I have the most pets", mostPets);
} else {
  mostPets = friendsPets;
  console.log("My friends have the most pets", mostPets);
}

// 17 - Write a *switch* statement that logs:
//      "First is the worst" if your lucky number is 1
//      "Second is the best" if your lucky number is 2
//      "Third is the one with the polka dot dress" if your lucky number is 3
//      Otherwise, log "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"
//      You'll need to research how to use switch statements!

switch (luckyNumber) {
  case 1:
    console.log("First is the worst");
  case 2:
    console.log("Second is the best");
  case 3:
    console.log("Third is the one with the polka dot dress");
  default:
    console.log("Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity");
}

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
// rewritten above
// adventures ? console.log("Adventures are great!") : console.log("How about we stay at home ? ");
